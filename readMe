# nsuns4 Downgrading 
This is a open source program which is using Depot Downloader to downgrade Nsuns4 to any version.

# Compiling
Just open it in Vs and build it..

# Issues
Currently I did not implement anything to copy paste the game in the steam dirc. (You need to replace the game files manually.

# Downgrading
This does nothing more than just runs a batch file which executes a command to downgrade the game. You just need to enter your steam name and password to downgrade the game.
There is no need to look for the -appid -depotid -manifestid -language -content

If the command shell is stuck at a percentage value click enter or space. If nothing happens just wait about 10 minutes and reclick. (Downgrading like that takes about 1-5 hours)
